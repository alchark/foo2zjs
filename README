GENERAL
    FOO2ZJS
    -------
    foo2zjs converts pbm (B/W) images and 1-bit-per-pixel cmyk images
    (both produced by ghostscript) to Zenographics ZJ-stream format. There
    is some information about the ZJS format at http://ddk.zeno.com.

    With foo2zjs, you can print to some HP and Minolta/QMS ZjStream
    printers, such as these:

	- Konica Minolta magicolor 2430 DL	B/W and color
	- Minolta/QMS 2300 DL			B/W and color
	- Minolta/QMS 2200 DL			B/W and color
	- HP LaserJet 1020			B/W
	- HP LaserJet 1018			B/W
	- HP LaserJet 1005			B/W
	- HP LaserJet 1000			B/W

    FOO2HP
    ------
    foo2hp converts pbm (B/W) images and N-bit-per-pixel cmyk images
    (both produced by ghostscript) to Zenographics ZJ-stream format. There
    is some information about the ZJS format at http://ddk.zeno.com.

    With foo2hp, you can print to some HP ZjStream printers, such as these:

	- HP Color LaserJet 2600n		B/W and color

    FOO2OAK
    -------
    foo2oak converts pbm (B/W) images and 1-bit-per-pixel cmyk images
    (both produced by ghostscript) to Oak Technology (now Zoran) OAKT
    format.

    With foo2oak, you can print to the HP LaserJet 1500 and possibly other
    OAKT protocol printers, such as these:

	- HP LaserJet 1500	B/W and color, but only 1-bit per pixel

Please read the manual pages for more details on the program operation.

BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES
    - Need to tune the manufacturer-supplied ICM color profiles to match the
      characteristics of Ghostscript.

    - Need to figure out how to get near-invisible dithering out of Ghostscript
      without affecting the colors.  With GS 7.05, if you set -dDITHERING=150,
      for example, the dithering becomes less visible but you get areas of
      color blotches.  No way to win.

    - Ghostscript 8.0 has worse color dithering compared to 7.05.  The symptom
      is slanted bands separated by 0.5 to 2mm, at a 30 degree angle.

    - Need to support a better input color file format which includes
      explicit page boundary indications.  The current use of the Ghostscript
      "bitcmyk" format precludes having pages of different sizes within a
      Postscript stream.

    - It is not entirely clear whether the JBIG-KIT compression library
      produces compressed data compatible with all implementations of JBIG
      in ZjStream printers.  It is possible that bugs or subtle
      implementation differences might result in incorrect printer behavior.

AUTHORS
    FOO2ZJS
    -------
    The foo2zjs engine program began life as Robert Szalai's 'pbmtozjs'
    program.  It also uses Markus Kuhn's JBIG-KIT compression library
    (included, but available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/),
    and Marti Maria's icc2ps program (included, but also available at
    http://www.littlecms.com).

    The foo2zjs engine was overhauled by Rick Richardson to add color
    support for the Minolta/QMS 2300DL, add command line options, limit
    data chunk size to 65536 bytes, and other miscellaneous features.
    Rick also contributed the zjsdecode program and the foomatic database
    entries for the Minolta/QMS magicolor 2300 DL.

    The latest version of foo2zjs can be found at:

	http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com
	wget http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/foo2zjs.tar.gz

    FOO2HP
    -------
    The foo2hp engine was written entirely from scratch by Rick Richardson.

    The latest version of foo2hp can be found at:

	${URLHP}
	wget ${URLHP}/foo2zjs.tar.gz
    FOO2OAK
    -------
    The foo2oak engine was written entirely from scratch by Rick Richardson.

    The latest version of foo2oak can be found at:

	http://foo2oak.rkkda.com
	wget http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/foo2zjs.tar.gz
