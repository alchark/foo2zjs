.SH NAME
foo2oak-wrapper \- Convert Postscript into an OAKT printer stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B foo2oak-wrapper
.RI [ options "] [" ps-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foo2oak-wrapper
is a Foomatic compatible printer wrapper for the \fBfoo2oak\fP printer driver.
This script reads a Postscript \fIps-file\fP or standard input
and converts it to Oak Technology OAKT printer format
for driving the HP Color LaserJet 1500 laser printer
and other OAKT-based printers.
.P
This script can be used in a standalone fashion, but is intended to
be called from a printer spooler system which uses the Foomatic
printer database.

These are the options used to customize the operation of \fBfoo2oak\fP
for a particular printer.
.TP
.BI \-u\0 xoff x yoff
Set the offset of the start of the printable region from the
upper left corner, in pixels [varies with paper size].
The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not
been tested on any other printers.
.TP
.BI \-l\0 xoff x yoff
Set the offset of the end of the printable region from the
lower right corner, in pixels [varies with paper size].
The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not
been tested on any other printers.
.TP
.BI \-L\0 mask
Send the logical clipping values from -u/-l in the OAKT stream.
\fBfoo2oak-wrapper\fP always runs Ghostscript with the ideal page dimensions,
so that the scale of the image is correct,
regardless whether or not the printer has unprintable regions.
This option is used to move the position of the clipped image
back to where it belongs on the page.  The default is to send
the amount which was clipped by -u and -l, and should be
good in most cases.
