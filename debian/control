Description: Support for printing to ZjStream-based printers
 foo2zjs is an open source printer driver for printers that use the
 Zenographics ZjStream wire protocol for their print data, such as the
 Minolta magicolor 2200/2300/2430 DL, Minolta Color PageWorks/Pro L and
 HP LaserJet 1000/1005/1018/1020/1022. These printers are often
 erroneously referred to as "winprinters" or "GDI printers".
 .
 The foomatic-db-engine package is recommended to simplify configuring
 this printer driver.  The psutils package is needed to enable n-up
 printing support.
